Firebase Setup Guide
📌Prepare your workspace: Install the Firebase CLI and log in (run firebase login) Install the Flutter SDK Create a Flutter project (run flutter create)
📌Install and run the FlutterFire CLI: From any directory, run this command: dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli Then, at the root of Flutter project directory, run this command: flutterfire configure --project=notetakeapp-18b01 This automatically registers per-platform apps with Firebase and adds a lib/firebase_options.dart configuration file to your Flutter project.
📌To initialize Firebase, call Firebase.initializeApp from the firebase_core package with the configuration from new firebase_options.dart file: import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart'; import 'firebase_options.dart';
// ... await Firebase.initializeApp( options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform, ); 📌
